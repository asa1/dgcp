- Fix date search
- Fix tag bug - perhaps query should include wildcard character instead?
- Allow queries without tag (just date and/or rating)
- Reorganize code into more logical/readable structure
- Change rating search to only match on photos matching tag queries? (Rather than match any photo in the same album with the specified rating)
- Add option to specify an alternate albumRoot (in case dgcp is run on a backup copy of the digikam database and collection, where the database root paths don't match)

dgcp
====

### A command line tool to search the Digikam's SQLite database, and copy matching albums to another directory. ###

Some hypothetical scenarios where dgcp is useful:

- You want to give your friend a copy of all the photo albums he appears in. Perhaps within a certain date range, or only containing highly rated photos. Currently, Digikam is not able to copy photos while maintaining the directory structure they photos are contained in, and Digikam is not able to copy entire albums that contain photos found through search results.

- You want to copy certain photos from your computer remotely using SSH/SFTP dgcp offers a crude method to search and copy the photos you are looking for.
